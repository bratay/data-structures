This is a pointer based Min Skew Heap with a terminal based menu the controls are as follows:

• Buildheap -  build the min-skew heap using the insert function.
• Insert -  insert x into the min-skew heap using the merge function. 
• Delete -  delete the element from the min-skew heap and merge the sub heaps.
• Find - print whether or not the given element is present in the min-skew heap.
• Merge(H1,H2) – this function  merge the two trees H1 and H2, where H1 and H2
are two min skew heaps. 
• Preorder  print the preorder traversal of the min-skew heap.
• Inorder -–  print the inorder traversal of the min-skew heap.
• Postorder –  print the postorder traversal of the min-skew heap.
• Levelorder –  print the level order traversal of the min-skew heap.

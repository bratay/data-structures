This is a pointer based Min Skew Heap with a terminal based menu the controls are as follows:

• Buildheap() -  builds the min-Skew heap using the insert function.
• Insert(x) - inserts x into the min-Skew heap using the merge function. 
• Deletemin() -  deletes the minimum value 
• Findmin() - prints the minimum value 
• Merge(H1,H2) – merges the two trees H1 and H2, where H1 and H2
are two min Skew heaps. 
• Preorder() - prints the preorder traversal of the min-Skew heap.
• Inorder() -  prints the inorder traversal of the min-Skew heap.
• Postorder() –  prints the postorder traversal of the min-Skew heap.
• Levelorder() –  prints the level order traversal of the min-Skew heap.
